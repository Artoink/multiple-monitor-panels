// Will need to connect to this signal
// Main.layoutManager.connect('monitors-changed', Lang.bind(this, this._updatePanels));

Known Issues:
1. need to re-sync when moving window across monitors
2. Starting app always show icon/animation on monitor with focused window, 
   could use global.get_pointer(), and check it by mouse.
3. connect signals (i.e. monitors-changed)
